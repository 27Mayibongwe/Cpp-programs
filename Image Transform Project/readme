# Image Transform Project

This is the final course project for the course Object Orientated Data Structures in C++.
In this assignment, you will begin with foundational work that will be used for several future assignments in this course. Specifically,
in Part 1 you will create a simple C++ class that represents a colored pixel; you are also provided with a PNG image class that encapsulates the loading and saving of image files. 
(You do not need to implement the PNG class yourself, but you'll find it enlightening to study the code provided.) In Part 2, you
will use the pixel and PNG classes from Part 1 to transform an image in several different ways.
